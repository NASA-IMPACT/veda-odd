```[tasklist]
- [ ] Complete a brainstorming exercise, such as dumping all ideas and known needs into a document. Include DS VEDA lead. This can start at any time.
- [ ] Organize those into various categories of work, such as "Dataset generation", "Community, or "titiler-xarray". This will help identify associated or dependent tasks as well as help team members identify which categories of work they are most interested in.
- [ ] Priotize ideas based on need for VEDA or technical context.
- [ ] Pruned based on capacity and interest.
- [ ] Refine the pruned list of ideas. Make sure all pruned ideas are described as objective statements, with subtasks as appropriate. Any number of objectives is fine as long as it matches capacity.
- [ ] Each objective should have an objective statement, motivation, tasks, risk, LOE, owner (see [Example 25.2 objectives](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A0lc_i4ycgM-uU8p7UAWfTR5I1h1-pMJXKDT8zDa1rk/edit?usp=sharing)).
- [ ] Create a sprint by sprint gantt chart (see last slide of [25.2 objectives](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A0lc_i4ycgM-uU8p7UAWfTR5I1h1-pMJXKDT8zDa1rk/edit?usp=sharing)).
- [ ] Meet about proposed plan with the project lead at IMPACT (i.e. Brian). This meeting is usually coordinated by the NASA project coordinator for all VEDA sub teams.
- [ ] Create objective tickets (delegate to owners of each objective).
