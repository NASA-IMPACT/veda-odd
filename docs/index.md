# ODD Overview

Welcome to the documentation for the Optimized Data Delivery (ODD) team, working on the Visualization, Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) and Earth Observation Data on the Cloud (EODC) projects.


## TiTiler Ecosystem Documentation

We work extensively with the TiTiler ecosystem - a powerful suite of Python tools for creating dynamic tile servers from geospatial datasets. These docs should help familiarize new and existing team members with the titiler ecoysystem.

### What is TiTiler?

TiTiler is a FastAPI-based framework designed to create dynamic tile servers for geospatial data. It provides a modular architecture that enables efficient serving of map tiles from various data sources including Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs and multi-dimensional scientific datasets.
