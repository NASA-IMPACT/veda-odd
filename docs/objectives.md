## Visualization

The commits per repository chart uses color-coding to show which objective each repo contributes to. Repos that contribute to multiple objectives are shown with split bars.

## Configuration

Objectives are configured in [`reports/config.py`](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-odd/blob/main/reports/config.py).

To regenerate this page from config:

```bash
cd reports
uv run generate_docs.py
```

See [FY26 Roadmap](./fy26-roadmap.md) for the broader context of these objectives.
